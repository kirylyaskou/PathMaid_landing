# PathMaid Landing

Standalone static landing page for PathMaid distribution. It has Russian (`/`) and English (`/en/`) pages, one shared stylesheet and script, and no build step or npm dependencies. Artwork lives in `assets/`; replace files there when final illustrations are ready.

Open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder with any static host.

## Hosting

Connect `kirylyaskou/PathMaid_landing` to your static hosting provider, select the `main` branch, and publish the repository root (`.`). Leave the build command empty: the site is already plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The public routes are `/`, `/en/`, and `/auth-confirmed/`. No SPA rewrite is needed.

## Release Links

Download buttons resolve assets from the latest GitHub release at runtime. If the GitHub API is temporarily unavailable, buttons fall back to the latest release page.

Supported downloads: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android ARM64 APK (manual installation). HTML links also lead to the release page when JavaScript is unavailable.

## Production Domain and Search

The canonical Russian URL is `https://www.pathmaid.site/`; the English URL is `https://www.pathmaid.site/en/`. The domain `pathmaid.site` is registered with hoster.by; `www` is a subdomain and does not require a separate purchase.

1. Add `www.pathmaid.site` as a custom domain in the hosting provider's settings.
2. At the DNS provider, configure the records supplied by that host. Replace the previous GitHub Pages records if moving to another provider, and configure `pathmaid.site` to redirect to `www.pathmaid.site`.
3. Enable HTTPS and verify the homepage, `/en/`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, and the apex-to-www redirect.
4. Verify a `pathmaid.site` domain property in Google Search Console using its DNS TXT record. Submit `https://www.pathmaid.site/sitemap.xml`, inspect both page URLs, and request indexing.
5. Verify `/auth-confirmed/` and any authentication redirect configuration when switching domains. Keep its existing `noindex` directive; it is intentionally excluded from the sitemap and remains crawlable so search engines can see `noindex`.

Publish the repository root unchanged, including `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`. The sitemap lists both public language pages. Each has its own canonical URL and reciprocal `hreflang` links; section anchors are not separate pages. Update the sitemap when adding public pages. Search Console reports indexing progress; neither a sitemap nor a request guarantees indexing or ranking for a query.

The remaining illustrations stay wired into the light design as temporary assets. Keep their filenames when replacing them with final artwork so both language pages update together.
